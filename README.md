# CourseraProject3
README for the Course Project of course Getting and Cleaning the Data. 
In the repo there are two files: *run_analysis.R* and *Codebook*

The script *run_analysis.R* follows the indications for the project as described by professors. In particular it: 
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The markdown file *Codebook* is the codebook of the project: it describes the variables and transformations performed in the script *run_analysis.R*
